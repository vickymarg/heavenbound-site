      <h2>Why I’m Speaking</h2>
      <p>
        Kayle Smith is the catalyst.<br><br>
        JayJay was headbutted and moments later attacked. I watched as the truth was twisted.<br><br>
        I speak because the lies must stop. This is for my son, and no one will silence me again.<br><br>
        Kayle’s mother has tried to rewrite the facts. But truth does not bend to protect the guilty.<br><br>
        I held JayJay’s hand for only a moment after they put him in a coma. I wasn’t there when he was asking for me. That guilt never fades.<br><br>
        This is my son’s truth — and I will honour it with every breath I have left.
